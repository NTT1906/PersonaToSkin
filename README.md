# PersonaToSkin
Annoyed of pmmp spawning colored skins for persona skins?

Here is a fix!
## Options
You can choose a custom set of skins in the plugin's skin folder.
The supported geometry is the wide default geometry

If you put several skins in the folder, the skins are randomly applied

If you disable the option or have no skins installed, the plugin will apply Steve
## Common issues & fixes
"gd not found" - gd must be in the PHP binaries and enabled! 

## Idea and help
Thanks alot to @provsalt for requesting the plugin! It was a cool and refreshing task!
Thanks to @DenielWorld for helping by looking up the functions!
